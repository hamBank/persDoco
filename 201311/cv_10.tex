\section{personal history}
I worked as a contracted theatrical technician as well as running a private help desk before becoming a contract programmer in February 1998. Over the next 5 years I worked with private enterprises, from small business through to the very large. Over the past 10 years I have worked in the Public Sector, enhancing and managing the Information Technology available to the Australian Government.

\subsubsection*{Staff Management}
Throughout my career I have been required to manage staff, a role I am comfortable in filling. Whilst at the Department of the Environment I was initially responsible for managing a small development team, and now manage a section of 16 IT professionals with a variety of skills.  I enjoy the interaction that comes with a management role and look forward to continuing this aspect of my career.  I particularly enjoy mentoring staff, it provides a significant personal satisfaction when I see staff excel.

\subsubsection*{Internet Technologies}
I have been involved in the Internet since 1991. I played a key role in the set up and operation of a small Internet Service Provider (ISP) CAPCOM. I currently administer a number of Internet sites in both Australia and overseas. I am involved with the Linux operating system, an Open Source system challenging the development practices of many traditional software developers. I have run Linux both privately and commercially since 1992. Over the past seven years I have been responsible for the management of secured internet gateway environments delivering secure, reliable and monitorable internet access to thousands of employees. These secured gateways host public facing web sites and applications listed as the most accessed Australian sites in their class.

\subsubsection*{ICT Security}
With the management of both internal and public facing systems comes a necessity to pro-actively manage a security posture. I have been actively involved in the security of IT systems for a number of organisations, including Government departments with International connections. In addition to the operational management of IT environments, I have prepared and interpreted policy documents, provided operational advice as well as participated in investigations. I regularly provide advice on how the changing policy environment will flow through to affect operational architecture and work practices.

\subsubsection*{Oracle \& Databases}
I have spent the last 15 years developing my Oracle and SQL skills. I have been responsible for the installation and configuration of new Oracle databases as well as ongoing adaptation to my clients requirements. I have become proficient in managing changes to database environments, while controlling the impact on planned objectives. While at the Australian Water Quality Center (AWQC) I was responsible for the planning and implementation of hardware environments to support a growing Data Warehouse providing the AWQC access to water testing results dating back to the early 1930â€™s. More recently I have led projects to upgrade to more recent releases of Oracle including re-engineering systems to take advantage of the new features available. I lead a project at the Department of the Environment to implement a virtualised environment for it's midrange and database systems a number of years before such implementations became a standard. This ground-breaking work led not only to significant financial savings but significant environmental efficiencies.

\subsubsection*{Web Development}
I have worked with a number of leading edge businesses in order to bring their products to the global Internet market. I have worked as a team leader to design, program and implement business critical software including e-commerce, financial and inventory management. A number of my clients have been purely online, requiring the utmost in software reliability. I have provided training in Internet technologies, both one-on-one, as well as in larger groups. Recently I have been assisting government clients with the development and deployment of Java based applications.

\subsubsection*{Budget Management}
Over the past five years I have been personally responsible for multi-million dollar budgets. I have been responsible for the management and delivery of large capital projects leading to significant improvements in the IT environment. While managing these budgets I frequently have to manage changing circumstances and demonstrate the diligence required with the expenditure of public money.

\subsubsection*{Personal Development}
I constantly strive to increase my knowledge, both through formal training and private study. I enjoy expanding my knowledge into new areas and am never satisfied in using a product or system without fully understanding the underlying technologies. I continue to expand my knowledge in the management and administration of information management technologies.
